## 1. Answer to Your Question

You want the ball (sphere) to "bounce" inside the canvas (the "cadre") when you click the mouse, instead of following the mouse. This means:
- The ball will move on its own, bouncing off the edges of the canvas.
- When you click the mouse, the ball will start moving (or maybe change direction).

Let's implement this step by step:
- We'll use variables to store the ball's position and speed.
- On each frame, we'll update the ball's position.
- If the ball hits the edge, it will "bounce" (reverse direction).
- When you click the mouse, the ball will start moving (or change direction).

Below is the updated code for your `index.html`. I've added comments to explain each part.

    <script>
      // Ball position and speed variables
      let ballX, ballY;      // Ball's position
      let speedX = 0;        // Ball's speed in X direction
      let speedY = 0;        // Ball's speed in Y direction
      let ballRadius = 50;   // Ball's radius

      function setup() {
        createCanvas(600, 400, WEBGL);
        // Start the ball in the center
        ballX = 0;
        ballY = 0;
      }

      function draw() {
        background(220);

        // Update ball position
        ballX += speedX;
        ballY += speedY;

        // Check for collision with the edges and bounce
        // The edges are at: left = -width/2, right = width/2, top = -height/2, bottom = height/2
        if (ballX + ballRadius > width/2 || ballX - ballRadius < -width/2) {
          speedX = -speedX; // Reverse X direction
          ballX = constrain(ballX, -width/2 + ballRadius, width/2 - ballRadius);
        }
        if (ballY + ballRadius > height/2 || ballY - ballRadius < -height/2) {
          speedY = -speedY; // Reverse Y direction
          ballY = constrain(ballY, -height/2 + ballRadius, height/2 - ballRadius);
        }

        // Draw the ball
        push();
        translate(ballX, ballY, 0);
        normalMaterial();
        sphere(ballRadius);
        pop();
      }

      // When the mouse is pressed, give the ball a random speed
      function mousePressed() {
        // Random speed between -5 and 5, but not zero
        speedX = random([-5, -4, -3, 3, 4, 5]);
        speedY = random([-5, -4, -3, 3, 4, 5]);
      }
    </script>

```

### Explanation

- We use variables to keep track of the ball's position (`ballX`, `ballY`) and speed (`speedX`, `speedY`).
- The `draw()` function updates the ball's position and checks if it hits the edge. If it does, it reverses direction (bounces).
- The `mousePressed()` function sets the ball's speed to a random value, making it start moving when you click.

## 3. Suggestions for Further Learning or Practice

- Try changing the ball's speed or size.
- Add a feature to stop the ball when you click again.
- Add color or sound effects when the ball bounces.
- Try making the ball bounce at an angle based on where you click.
- Explore the [P5.js reference](https://p5js.org/reference/) for more ideas.

**Encouragement:**  
Great job exploring animation and interactivity! If you want to add more features or have questions about how the code works, just ask. Would you like to try adding more balls, or maybe make the ball speed up each time it bounces?
